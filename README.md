I utilized a dataset of red wine from Kaggle to construct various classification models and determine the best-performing model among them. The dataset assigns a quality score ranging from 0 to 10 for each type of wine, based on its quality.

**The independent variables by which the prediction of best quality of wine is made are :**
_Fixed acidity
Volatile acidity
Citric acid
Residual sugar
Chlorides
Free sulfur dioxide
Total sulfur dioxide
Density
pH
Sulfates
Alcohol_

**Steps in this project :**
_Importing the dataset
Analyze and clean the data
Understanding the Dataset
Preparing the Data for modelling
Applying various models_
Choosing the right and best performing model_
