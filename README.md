Wine Quality Prediction Using ML:
[pexels-mariapop-342971](https://github.com/mrpaul017/Wine_quality_prediction/assets/145193843/8e351c0c-98d5-46a0-887d-229d17781a68) 
I utilized a dataset of red wine from Kaggle to construct various classification models and determine the best-performing model among them. The dataset assigns a quality score ranging from 0 to 10 for each type of wine, based on its quality.

**The independent variables by which the prediction of best quality of wine is made are :**
Fixed acidity
Volatile acidity
Citric acid
Residual sugar
Chlorides
Free sulfur dioxide
Total sulfur dioxide
Density
pH
Sulfates
Alcohol

**Steps in this project :**
Importing the dataset
Analyze and clean the data
Understanding the Dataset
Preparing the Data for modelling
Applying various models
Choosing the right and best performing model
