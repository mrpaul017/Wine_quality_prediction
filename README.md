# Wine Quality Prediction Using ML
![pexels-mariapop-342971](https://github.com/mrpaul017/Wine_quality_prediction/assets/145193843/159890d3-ec44-46b6-b738-ee9754ab4a28)

I utilized a dataset of red wine from Kaggle to construct various classification models and determine the best-performing model among them. The dataset assigns a quality score ranging from 0 to 10 for each type of wine, based on its quality.

- Dataset link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009

## The independent variables by which the prediction of best quality of wine is made are :

- Fixed acidity
- Volatile acidity
- Citric acid
- Residual sugar
- Chlorides
- Free sulfur dioxide
- Total sulfur dioxide
- Density
- pH
- Sulfates
- Alcohol


## Steps in this project :

- Importing the dataset
- Analyze and clean the data
- Exploratory Data Analysis 
- Preparing the Data for modelling
- Applying various models
- Choosing the right and best-performing model
