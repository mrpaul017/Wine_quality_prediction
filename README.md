I utilized a dataset of red wine from Kaggle to construct various classification models and determine the best-performing model among them. The dataset assigns a quality score ranging from 0 to 10 for each type of wine, based on its quality.
The independent variables by which the prediction of best quality of wine is made are :
[UploadFixed acidity
Volatile acidity
Citric acid
Residual sugar
Chlorides
Free sulfur dioxide
Total sulfur dioxide
Density
pH
Sulfates
